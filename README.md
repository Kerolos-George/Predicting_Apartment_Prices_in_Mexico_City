## Methodology
  The methodology used for this project involves the following steps:

1-Data Preprocessing - cleaning the data, handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and scaling numeric features.
2-Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) - analyzing the dataset and visualizing the relationships between the features and the target variable.
3-Feature Selection - selecting the most relevant features to include in the model based on EDA.
4-Model Selection - testing and evaluating different regression models to find the best one for the task.
5-Model Tuning - fine-tuning the selected model using hyperparameter optimization.
6-Model Evaluation - evaluating the performance of the final model on a holdout dataset.

## Algorithms Used

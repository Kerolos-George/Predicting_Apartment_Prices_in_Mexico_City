# Predicting_Apartment_Prices_in_Mexico_City
This project aims to build a machine learning model that can predict the prices of apartments in Mexico City based on various features such as location, size, number of bedrooms, etc. The dataset used for this project is publicly available on Kaggle 
## Data
 The dataset used for this project is available in the data folder 
## Methodology
  The methodology used for this project involves the following steps:

1-Data Preprocessing - cleaning the data, handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and scaling numeric features.
<br>
2-Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) - analyzing the dataset and visualizing the relationships between the features and the target variable.
<br>
3-Feature Selection - selecting the most relevant features to include in the model based on EDA.
<br>
4-Model Selection - testing and evaluating different regression models to find the best one for the task.
<br>
5-Model Tuning - fine-tuning the selected model using hyperparameter optimization.
<br>
6-Model Evaluation - evaluating the performance of the final model on a holdout dataset.

## Algorithms Used
1-Linear Regression
<br>
2-Ridge
